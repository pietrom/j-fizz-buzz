"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead
 of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three 
 and five print “FizzBuzz”."

ALREADY IMLPEMENTED
- program should print numbers from 1 to 100
- program should print "Fizz" instead of the number for multiples of three
- program should print "Buzz" instead of the number for multiples of five
- program should print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number for multiples of both three and five
- both values 1 and 100 should be parameterized instead of hardcoded constants
- both values 3 and 5 should be parameterized instead of hardcoded constants
- both values "Fizz" and "Buzz" should be parameterized instead of hardcoded constants
